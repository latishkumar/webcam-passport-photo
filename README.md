## How to

1. Stand next to a solid background like a wall
2. Place laptop or hold phone at eye-level
3. Don't forget to look up at the camera
4. Photos produced are `600x600` pixels or `2"` printed at `300dpi`
5. Develop at CVS, Wallgreens or RiteAid on `4x6"`

## Philosophy

Laws are important, but they should not burden those ruled. The Post Office passport photo service costs $15. Here a free alternative you can use yourself. Fork as you like.
